			<h1>Now</h1>
			<p class="tagline">A snapshot of what I'm up to — inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">nownownow.com</a>.</p>

			<h2>Work</h2>
			<p>
				Solutions Architect at <a href="https://launch.nttdata.com" target="_blank">Launch by NTT DATA</a>, helping enterprise clients figure out what to actually do with emerging technology. A lot of my energy right now is going into mobile banking architecture, RFP work, and translating "we should use AI" into something that actually means something to a business.
			</p>

			<h2>Writing</h2>
			<p>
				You're looking at it. I started this blog because I had opinions and nowhere useful to put them. That's still true. Currently thinking through posts on AI adoption in enterprise environments, what empathy looks like when teams are smaller and pressure is higher, and whether the tech industry is having a reckoning or just a bad couple of years.
			</p>

			<h2>Thinking About</h2>
			<p>
				Spatial computing. Apple Vision Pro has been in my hands a lot, and I keep coming back to the same question: the technology is extraordinary, but are the use cases catching up? Feels like we're in the "car without roads" moment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also: what good leadership looks like when job security feels fragile for everyone on your team.
			</p>

			<h2>Reading</h2>
			<p>
				<em>The Art of War</em> — probably my fifth time through. Still hits differently depending on where you are in life.
