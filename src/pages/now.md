## Writing

You’re reading it! 
## Thinking About

* What’s the best way to make change when you’re not in charge of the things you want to change? 
* How do you get people on your side to make change or at least understand your perspective without it feeling like it’s personal, or an attack, or a lack of faith/belief in your leaders? 
* How do you stop people from saying wild things in the chats at work?! 
* Should I go back to making fantasy football spreadsheets to track how I want to operate in my drafts?! 
## Reading

Caveat… I’m really good at STARTING books, but as my wife would say anytime I buy a book (I’m great at buying books btw, especially for other people — if you and I know one another and you want to see an example… let me know and I’ll find a great book for you lol) — “but you don’t read?”

That being said these are books I’ve started lately lol.

* Strong Ground - Brene Brown
* Enshittification - Cory Doctorow
* Win Every Argument - Medhi Hassan 
* Nemisis Games - James S.A. Corey

## TV/Movies

Movies:

* Sinners (awesome fun time but weird)
* Bugonia (wtf even was that I’m still thinking about it and am still in the wtf awe lol)
* One Battle After Another (hated it - it’s really tough for me to get over the first thirty ish minutes… like I just hate everyone in that movie so much, and even Benicio and Leo being charming after that can’t save it for me)

TV Shows (Paying attention category):

* All the Yellowstone properties — they’re just really well done. Well written, acted, in beautiful surroundings, and just evokes a part of the american story that I think we wish was true more than was actually true. 
* A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms — I wish I had a citation but someone called this “A Knights Tale but in the Game of Thrones universe” and it’s so true lol. 
* The Weekly Show with Jon Oliver — thank god Jon is back

TV Shows/Movies (Background noise category):

* Top Chef — it doesn’t leave the queue. It’s great noise.
* Andor Trilogy — this trilogy specifically is the Andor TV series, followed by Rouge One, followed by A New Hope and it’s the unequivocal best trilogy in Star Wars
* Godfather 1/2 — Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) died and I had to honor his memory

Podcasts

Sports:
* Bill Simmons Show — Bill is still fun even though he’s clearly entered his “old man” phase where he constantly says things that aren’t accurate and can’t remember names (granted he was always bad with names lol) but you can’t beat guess the lines, or his arguments with Zach Lowe even if I don’t want to listen to all the ancillary things he’s on anymore
* The Ringer Fantasy Football Show/Draft Show — they’re the same show but they change names after the season. They’re the only show that does this. And it’s so dumb but so hilarious. These guys crack me up and I love them. THANK YOU LORNE!

Politics:
* All the Crooked Media stuff lol — Pod Save America, Pod Save the World, PSA OnlyFriends, Terminally Online (the greatest podcast out there), Hysteria, etc.
* Anything Mehdi Hassan does — literally
* The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart — it’s just elder millenial political porn at this point but that doesn’t mean I don’t listen religiously

Nerdy shit:
* House of R — when they’re talking about things I know about lol
* All Fantasy Everything — always amazing
* The Vergecast — when I need to get smarter
* Pablo Torre Finds Out — could this be in sports? probably! but whatever it’s going here lol
