I was gonna write a wrapping up the year post.

But I’m so tired of 2025.

So here’s the post: let’s all work to make 2026 a more thoughtful, empathetic, and kind year than this year was. I’m sick of hearing about how awfully we all treat each other. About the horrors of this world. 

Let’s find a way to make whatever good we can in 2026.

I’m gonna take a break for the next two weeks (and today unless you count this as a post which… would be generous of you lol), and do my best to decompress and come back in 2026, ready to live my values and do what I think is right. I hope you also get that opportunity!

Happy holidays ya’ll, and let’s toast this year and be glad it’s in the rear view.
