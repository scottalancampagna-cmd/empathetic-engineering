So I started a “new” job this week - leaving behind my engineering team that I love in order to try and help our company to be more efficient and effective, while providing more opportunities to not just my old team but all the people in our crew. 

That being said, I couldn’t let the opportunity go to waste, so this week’s meme pokes fun at the fact that I left my team behind, and that they probably would have loved to see SOME aspects of my leadership style go by the wayside… but instead, they get this bullshit from me lol. 

Behold, this week’s timesheet meme! For reference, my team was the “Emerging and Immersive” Tech team, which is why I call them E and I!
