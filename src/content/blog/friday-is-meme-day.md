I don’t know if this is worthy of even being a post let alone the first one I put behind the paywall, but whatever. We’re all just goofing around trying shit out in this life right? Speaking of which, today’s Friday timesheet meme has a a little story behind it… 

I’m transitioning to a role that I’ve been fulfilling as a side hustle, but turning into a real gig at the office, which is why there’s a reference to me leaving (I’m sure I’ll dive into it more in a future post but… not today friends, this is just a goof I’m doing for now to leave you in suspense). I’m not “leaving” anything I’m just doing a slightly different thing than I was before! But that won't stop the memes. Nothing can stop the memes.
